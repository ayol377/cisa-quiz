Effective access controls are, in themselves, a positive but, for reasons outlined above, may not sufficiently compensate for other control weaknesses. In this situation, the IS auditor needs to be proactive.

A weekend can be used as a time buffer so that the new system will have a better chance of being up and running after the weekend. A different data representation does not mean different data presentation at the front end. Even when this is the case, this issue can be solved by adequate training and user support.

      "explanation": "The main function of QoS is to optimize network performance by assigning priority to business applications and end users through the allocation of dedicated parts of the bandwidth to specific traffic. Choice A is not true because the communication itself will not be improved. While the speed of data exchange for specific applications could be faster, availability will not be improved. The QoS tools that many carriers are using do not provide reports of service levels; however, there are other tools that will generate service-level reports. Even when QoS is integrated with firewalls, VPNs, encryption tools, and others, the tool itself is not intended to provide security controls."

This does not necessarily ensure that services are delivered at the highest achievable level of availability (e.g., redundancy and clustering). Although maximizing availability might be necessary for some critical services, it cannot be applied as a general rule of thumb. SLM cannot ensure that costs for all services will be kept at a low or minimum level since costs associated with a service will directly reflect the customer's requirements. Monitoring and reporting legal noncompliance is not a part of SLM."

      "explanation": "From an IS auditor's perspective, the primary objective of auditing the management of service providers should be to determine if the services that were requested were provided in a way that is acceptable, seamless, and in line with contractual agreements. Minimizing costs, if applicable and achievable (depending on the customer's need), is traditionally not part of an IS auditor's job. This would normally be done by a line management function within the IT department. Furthermore, during an audit, it is too late to minimize the costs for existing provider arrangements. Subcontracting providers could be a concern, but it would not be the primary concern. Transferring knowledge to the internal IT department might be desirable under certain circumstances, but should not be the primary concern of an IS auditor when auditing IT service providers and the management thereof."

      "explanation": "It is important that negotiated and agreed commitments (i.e., service level agreements [SLAs]) can be fulfilled all the time. If this were not achievable, IT should not have agreed to these requirements, as entering into such a commitment would be misleading to the business. 'All the time' in this context directly relates to the 'agreed obligations' and does not imply that a service has to be available 100 percent of the time. Costs are a result of availability and service continuity management and may only be partially controllable. These costs directly reflect the agreed-upon obligations. Capacity management is necessary but not sufficient for availability. Despite the possibility that a lack of capacity may result in an availability issue, providing the necessary capacity for seamless operations of services would be done within capacity management, and not within availability management. Generating reports might be a task of availability and service continuity management, but that is true for many other areas of interest as well (e.g., incident, problem, capacity, and change management)."

Protecting the server in a secure location and setting a boot password are good practices, but do not ensure that a user will not try to exploit logical vulnerabilities and compromise the OS.

The conventions can be structured, so resources beginning with the same high-level qualifier can be governed by one or more generic rules. This reduces the number of rules required to adequately protect resources, which in turn facilitates security administration and maintenance efforts. Reducing the number of rules required to protect resources allows for the grouping of resources and files by application, which makes it easier to provide access. Ensuring that resource names are not ambiguous cannot be achieved through the use of naming conventions.

When network traffic passes the firewall unintentionally, the logical access controls form a second line of defense. Using two firewalls of different vendors to consecutively check the incoming network traffic is an example of diversity in defense. The firewalls are the same security mechanisms. By using two different products, the probability of both products having the same vulnerabilities is diminished.

The risk that more than one individual can claim to be a specific user is associated with the authentication processes, rather than with authorization.

Looking over the shoulder of a user to obtain sensitive information could be done by an unauthorized person who has gained access to areas using piggybacking, but this policy specifically refers to physical access control. Shoulder surfing would not be prevented by the implementation of this policy. Dumpster diving, looking through an organization's trash for valuable information, could be done outside the company's physical perimeter; therefore, this policy would not address this attack method.

It is one of the most common abuses because it requires limited technical knowledge and occurs before computer security can protect the data. There are only compensating controls for data diddling. Piggybacking is the act of following an authorized person through a secured door and can be prevented by the use of deadman doors. Logical piggybacking is an attempt to gain access through someone who has the rights, e.g., electronically attaching to an authorized telecommunication link to possibly intercept transmissions. This could be prevented by encrypting the message. Viruses are malicious program code inserted into another executable code that can self-replicate and spread from computer to computer via sharing of computer diskettes, transfer of logic over telecommunication lines, or direct contact with an infected machine.\nAntiviral software can be used to protect the computer against viruses. The shutdown of an application\ncan be initiated through terminals or microcomputers connected directly (online) or indirectly (dial-up line) to the computer.

      "explanation": "FAR is the frequency of accepting an unauthorized person as authorized, thereby granting access when it should be denied. In an organization with high security requirements, user annoyance with a higher FRR is less important, since it is better to deny access to an authorized individual than to grant access to an unauthorized individual. EER is the point where the FAR equals the FRR; therefore, it does not minimize the FAR. FIR is the probability that an authorized person is identified but is assigned a false ID."

Use of palm scanning entails placing a hand on a scanner where a palm's physical characteristics are captured. Hand\ngeometry, one of the oldest techniques, measures the physical characteristics of the user's hands and fingers from a three-dimensional perspective. The palm and hand biometric techniques lack uniqueness in the geometry data. In face biometrics, a reader analyzes the images captured for general facial characteristics.

It is the agency's interaction with the organization that needs to be protected. Auditing their processes would not be relevant in this scenario. Training the employees of the external agency may be one control procedure but could be performed after access has been granted.

Choice B is not a concern because if the name and address of the organization were written on the card, a malicious finder could use the card to enter the organization's premises. Separating card issuance from technical rights management is a method to ensure a proper segregation of duties so that no single person can produce a functioning card for a restricted area within the organization's premises. Choices B and C are good practices, not concerns. Choice D may be a concern, but not as important since a system failure of the card programming device would normally not mean that the readers do not function anymore.

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Having an alternative standby processor at another network node would be the best solution. The unavailability of the central communications processor would disrupt all access to the banking network, resulting in the disruption of operations for all the shops. This could be caused by failure of equipment, power, or communications. Offsite storage of backups would not help, since EFT tends to be an online process and offsite storage will not replace the dysfunctional processor. The provision of an alternate processor onsite would be fine if it were an equipment problem, but would not help in the case of a power outage. Installation of duplex communication links would be most appropriate if it were only the communication link that failed."

Disaster recovery should not rely on key staff since a disaster can occur when they are not available. It is common that not all systems can be tested in a limited test time frame. It is important, however, that those systems which are essential to the business are tested, and that the other systems are eventually tested throughout the year. One aim of the test is to identify and replace defective devices so that all systems can be replaced in the case of a disaster.\nChoice B would only be a concern if the number of discovered problems is systematically very high; in a real disaster, there is no need for a clean shutdown of the original production environment since the first priority is to bring the backup site up."

The quicker information assets can be restored and business processing resumed, the smaller the downtime costs. However, the expenditure needed to have the redundant capability required to recover information resources might be prohibitive for nonessential business processes. Recovery operations do not determine the acceptable time period for the resumption of critical business processes, and indirect downtime costs should be considered in addition to the direct cash outflows incurred due to business disruption. The indirect costs of a serious disruption to normal business activity, e.g., loss of customer and supplier goodwill and loss of market share, may actually be more significant than direct costs over time, thus reaching the point where business viability is threatened."
